Here are some scripts for automatic tasks:  
1. [genAll.sh](./genAll.sh) is used to checkout all the projects which have been patched and evaluated correctness from [defects4j](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j). For the projects information, please refer to: https://github.com/Ultimanecat/DefectRepairing  
2. [patchAll.sh](./patchAll.sh) is used to do patch all the buggy versions. File structure should follow the structure generated by [genAll.sh](./genAll.sh). Patches are from [DefectRepairing](https://github.com/Ultimanecat/DefectRepairing). Change the project name in the script when using.  
3. [coverageTests.sh](./coverageTests.sh) is used to do coverage (based on [defects4j](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j)) for each test case and find the tests cases related to the buggy class. It can be parallel, but no promise for competition condition (which is few possibility).  
4. [filter_related_tests.py](./filter_related_tests.py) is used to filter the tests that cover the buggy method from the coverage reports generated by [coverageTests.sh](./coverageTests.sh).  
5. [filter_passing_tests.py](./filter_passing_tests.py) is used to reject the failure tests from [related_tests](./filter_related_tests.py).  
6. [gen4finvs.sh](./gen4finvs.sh) is used to generate invariants for all failure tests. It sould be put on the root of the project folder.  
7. [gen4pinvs.sh](./gen4pinvs.sh) is used to generate invariants for all passing tests. It sould be put on the root of the project folder.  
8. [geninvs4allbug.sh](./gen4all) is used to put the 6, 7 to the project folder and exectue the in batch.  
9. [printinvs.sh](./printinvs.sh) is used to print invariants in batch.  
10. [processJSON.py](./processJSON.py) is used to change the format of [invariants diff](https://github.com/boyang9602/invsdiff) result to fit [d3js hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy/tree/v1.1.9).

File structures and some of the filenames are hardcoded.
